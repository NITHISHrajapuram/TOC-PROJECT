# TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM
The traveling salesman problem is considered to be a noteworthy and standard problem in view of combinative optimization. This problem is based on the routing system and to determine the shortest way that a salesman will take to travel to different cities starting from the origin and returning to the origin city. The distance between the cities is delivered. This problem is an NP-hard problem and considering the real-life scenario, there is a need for sub-optimal solutions instead of optimal solutions. The individuals who are directly related to the logistics and planning sector, really care about this problem to be solved in a real-life scenario. Aiming towards a real-life illustration, a program manager of any band manages and schedule a number of the program in various cities with a full-proof plan to avoid unnecessary time consumption as well as cost. Owing to this reason, they are keen to find the shortest path to travel the least distance and help the entire crew not to get exhausted at the end of the day. In this scenario, the traveling salesman's problem solving is the best way to deal with the shortest path through OR tools using SAT solver. The algorithm of dynamic programming helps in finding the best possible solution for the traveling salesman problem, in which the complexity of time exponentially upsurges with the increase in the number of cities .
